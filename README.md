# Estimation of the streamwise velocity in a partially vegetated open channel flow

Working on creating code that can estimate the streamwise velocity in a partially vegetated open channel flow. \
Interest is based on wave interactions with roots of mangrove trees. \
Code is based on equations (13) - (16) in Liu & Chang (2019). \
Still working on finding a fix for the non-linear boundary condition
